## Computer Science Capstone
This ePortfolio represents my work and growth throughought the Computer Science program adn serves as the final capstone of my Bachelors of Science Degree.

### Professional Self Assessment 
Completing the Computer Science program and building this ePortfolio has been a new and challenging experience for me. Coming into the program, I did not have prior industry
experience in computer science, and my previous professional background was primarily in customer service and healthcare, not IT. Because of this, much of what I learned throughout
the program involved not only developing technical skills, but also learning how software projects are approaced, built, and improved in a professional setting.

One of the biggest takeaways from this program was resilience. Manhy projets required problem-solving through trial and error, revisiting earlier decisions, and improving work
afer receiving feedback. I learned that writing code is rarely a one time process. Instead, effecrive solutions come from reviewing what works, identifying areas for improvement, 
and refining the code to make it simpler, more efficient, and easier for users and collaborators to understand. 

Courses such as Software Development Lifecycle gave me insight into how teams work together to bring a product from concept to completion. I learned about differend development 
approaches, such as Agile and Scrum, and the various roles involved in a collaborative developent team. Understanding these roles helped me see how individual contributions fit into a larger system and reinforced my interest in analytical and support-focused roles within the technology field. 

Collaboration and communication were recurring themes thoughout my coursework. I learned that writing simiple, readable code makes collaboration easier, especially when working with 
people who may not be familiar with the project. Keeping code organized and easy to follow supports teamwork and long-term maintenance. My background in customer service also influenced how I approach communication with stakeholders. I learned that clear, starightforward explanations are foten more effective than using technical jargon, especially when working wiht audiences that have varying levels of technical knowledge. 

Throughout the program, I developed a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms and how they impact performance and effciency. I learned how different data structures
behave across programming languages and how design choices affect memory usage and time complexity. This helped me become more intentional when selecting data structures and algorithms, focusing on choosing solutions that balance efficency and simplicity. 

In addition, I also gained experience in software engineering practices, working with databases, and developing security aware-mindset. I learned how to structure programs in a modular way, incorporate persistent data storage, and consider basic security principles such as data protection and system reliability. While security was not always the primary focus for each project, the program ephasized thinking aead abotu potential vulnerabilities and design flaws. 

The artifacts included in this ePortfolio demonstrate my growth across software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. I chose to use a single artifact originally created in my CS 300 Data Structures and Algorithms course, a C++ program designed to manage a catalog of college courses and their prerequisites. The original program read data from a CSV file and allowed users to view all courses or retreive information for a specific course. 

For the software design and engineering enhancement, I rewrote the program in Python. This allowed me to simplify the overall structure, reduce unnecessary helper functions, and take 
advantage of Python's built-in features for handling data and formating. The result was a cleaner and more readable program that is easier to understand and collaborate on. 

For the algorithms and data structures enhancement, I reevaluated my original design choices and replaced binary search tree with a dictionary, which proved to be a more appropriate and efficient data structure for the task. I also implemented recursion to retreive prerequisite information, improving both clarity and functionality. 

For the database enhancement, I integrated a SQLite database to store course information rather than reading from a flat file each time. This improvement added persistence adn better 
reflected real-world application design. 

Together, these enhancement demonstrate my ability to design, evaluate, and improve computing solutions using appropriate tools and techniques. This ePortfolio represents my growth throughout the Computer Science program and serves as an introduction to the technical artifacts taht follow, highlighting my readiness to transition into the computer science field with a strong foundation and a willingness to continue learning.
