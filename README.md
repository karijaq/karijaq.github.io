## Computer Science Capstone

This ePortfolio represents my work and growth throughought the Computer Science program adn serves as the final capstone of my Bachelors of Science Degree.
### Professional Self-Assesment
Completing the Computer Science program and building this ePortfolio has been a new and challenging experience for me. Coming into the program, I did not have prior industry experience in computer science, and my previous professional background was primarily in customer service and healthcare rather than IT. Because of this, much of what I learned throughout the program involved not only developing technical skills, but also learning how software projects are approached, built, and improved in a professional setting.

One of the biggest takeaways from this program was resilience. Many projects required problem-solving through trial and error, revisiting earlier decisions, and improving work after receiving feedback. I learned that writing code is rarely a one-time process. Instead, effective solutions come from reviewing what works, identifying areas for improvement, and refining the code to make it simpler, more efficient, and easier for users and collaborators to understand.

Courses such as Software Development Lifecycle gave me insight into how teams work together to bring a product from concept to completion. I learned about different development approaches, such as Agile and Scrum, and the various roles involved in a collaborative development team. Understanding these roles helped me see how individual contributions fit into a larger system and reinforced my interest in analytical and support-focused roles within the technology field.

Collaboration and communication were recurring themes throughout my coursework. I learned that writing simple, readable code makes collaboration easier, especially when working with people who may not be familiar with the project. Keeping code organized and easy to follow supports teamwork and long-term maintenance. My background in customer service also influenced how I approach communication with stakeholders. I learned that clear, straightforward explanations are often more effective than using technical jargon, especially when working with audiences that have varying levels of technical knowledge.

Throughout the program, I developed a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms and how they impact performance and efficiency. I learned how different data structures behave across programming languages and how design choices affect memory usage and time complexity. This helped me become more intentional when selecting data structures and algorithms, focusing on choosing solutions that balance efficiency and simplicity.

I also gained experience in software engineering practices, working with databases, and developing a security-aware mindset. I learned how to structure programs in a modular way and consider basic security principles such as data protection and system reliability. While security was not always the primary focus of each project, the program emphasized thinking ahead about potential vulnerabilities and design flaws.

The artifact included in this ePortfolio demonstrates my growth across software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. I chose to use a single artifact originally created in my CS 300 Data Structures and Algorithms course, a C++ program designed to manage a catalog of college courses and their prerequisites. The original program read data from a CSV file and allowed users to view all courses or retrieve information for a specific course.

For the software design and engineering enhancement, I rewrote the program in Python. This allowed me to simplify the overall structure, remove unnecessary helper functions, and take advantage of Python’s built-in features for handling data and formatting. The result was a cleaner and more readable program that is easier to understand and collaborate on.

For the algorithms and data structures enhancement, I reevaluated my original design choices and replaced the binary search tree with a dictionary, which proved to be a more appropriate and efficient data structure for this task. I also implemented recursion to retrieve prerequisite information, improving both clarity and functionality.

For the database enhancement, I integrated a SQLite database to store course information rather than reading from a flat file each time. This improvement added persistence and better reflected real-world application design.

Together, these enhancements demonstrate my ability to meet all course outcomes for the Computer Science capstone, including collaboration, communication, software design, algorithmic thinking, database integration, and security awareness. I am confident that the work presented in this ePortfolio reflects my technical growth and readiness to enter the computer science field.

This ePortfolio represents my growth throughout the Computer Science program and serves as an introduction to the technical artifact that follows, highlighting my readiness to transition into the computer science field with a strong foundation and a willingness to continue learning.
